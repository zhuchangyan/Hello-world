Say something I am giving upon on you
I will be the one if you want me to
Anywhere I would've followed you 
Say something I am giving upon you 
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
And not on my own
And I was stumble and fool
I am still learning to love
Just starting to crawl

Say something I am giving upon you
I am sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something I am giving upon on you
And I would swallow my pride 
You are the one that I love
I am saying goodbye
Say somethin I am giving upon you
And sorry that I couldnt get to you 
And anywhere I would have folowed you 
Say something I am giving upon you
